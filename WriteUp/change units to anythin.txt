There was an issue that not all subjects used the units system
while this did work for some, i.e computer science this didnt
work for all. Therefore on MainPage, lines 20 -> 25 had to be changed.
This now allowed for any name to be given and still work as well as submit 
the scores using that 'Unit' name.

What are 3 disadvantages of using CSV's?,"Inefficient when using large amounts of data, Can only store text, Unable to search and sort"

What is a flat-file database?,A database in which all the data is stored in a single table

What is redundant data?,Data that is repeated in a database

What is a primary key?,A field used to uniquely identify a specific row of data from a table

What is a foreign key?,A primary key of one table that appears as an attribute in another table and acts to provide a logical relationship between the two tables

What is a relational database?,A set of tables whose records are linked by certain fields

What are the three types of entity relationships?,"One to one, One to many, Many to many"

What is a one to one relationship?,A relationship where one entity is linked to one other entity

What is a one to many relationship?,A relationship where one entity is linked to several entities

What is a many to many relationship?,A relationship where several entities are linked to several other entities

What is an example of a one to one relationship?,Person to driving license

What is an example of a one to many relationship?,"Manufacturer to models 1, 2 and 3"

What is an example of a many to many relationship?,"Parent 1 and 2 to children 1, 2 and 3"

What is referential integrity?,Referential integrity helps to ensure that there are no data redundancy and inaccuracies between linked tables, and prevents a record containing a foreign key from using a value that doesn't exist in the linked table where it is a primary key

How many stages of normalisation are there?,3

What 3 rules must a database in 1st normal form obey?,All rows must be unique
Each cell must only contain a single value
Each value should be non-divisible

What 2 rules must a database in 2nd normal form obey?,Database must be in first normal form. Non-partial dependency - All non-prime attributes should be fully functionally dependent on the primary key

What 2 rules must a database in 3rd normal form obey?,Database must be in first and second normal form. No transitive dependency - All fields must only be determinable by the primary/composite key, not by other keys

What are the 7 main SQL statements?,"CREATE, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, ORDER BY, WHERE, INSERT INTO"

What does the SQL statement CREATE do?,Creates a database table

What does the SQL statement SELECT do?,Selects data

What does the SQL statement UPDATE do?,Edits data

What does the SQL statement DELETE do?,Removes data

What does the SQL statement ORDER BY do?,Orders data by either ASC or DESC (Ascending or Descending)

What does the SQL statement INSERT INTO do?,Adds new data

What is the SQL statement WHERE similar to?,An if statement

What does SQL stand for?,Structured Query Language

What does * stand for in SQL?,All

What does DBMS stand for?,Database Management System

What is a table within a database?,A collection of data that relates to an entity

What is a record within a database?,A collection of data about a single entity

What is a field within a database?,A unique piece of data about any entity

What is a field name within a database?,An identifier for the single pieces of data

What are attributes within a database?,A characteristic of an entity

What is an entity with a database?,Something in the real world that we store data about

What is normalisation?,The process of restructuring a database in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity

When do we use a junction table?,When we want to make a many to many relationship a many to one

What happens when making a junction table?,The ID's of both tables are combined

What are the two types of compression?,Lossy Lossless

What is compression?,The process of making a files size smaller

What is lossy compression?,"Lossy compression works by permanently removing some of the data from a file. However, enough of the data remains so that the file is still useful and there are no noticeable differences"

What is lossless compression?,Compression in which all the original data can be recovered when the file is decompressed

Which type of compression results in greater reduction of the file size?,Lossy

What is lossless compression good for?,"Executable files, where all the data is necessary"

What does RLE stand for?,Run-length encoding

What is RLE?,A form of lossless compression that replaces repeating sequences of 0s and 1s with more efficient representations

How does RLE work?,Each repeating string is replaced by a code which represents the character and the amount of times it is to be repeated

How does RLE work for images?,In images adjacent pixels are likely to be similar colours. Image compression algorithms group pixels together and give them an average colour.
This technique is lossy

What is encryption?,The process of scrambling data according to a specific algorithm so it can't be read by third parties

What are encryption keys used for?,Encryption Keys are used to scramble and unscramble the data in a message. It would take an impractical amount of time to guess the key so we say that the encryption is secure

What is hashing?,The process of taking an input and performing some form of calculation on the input which will output a value of a fixed size

What is the output of a hashing algorithm called?,A hash

Why is a hashing algorithm so secure?,It can't be reversed

What can hashing be used for?,Storing passwords

What software do search engines make use of?,Web crawlers

Where do web crawlers store key information about each page they search?,In an index

What is search engine indexing?,The method of collecting information about various web pages and storing them in an index which will be used by the search engine to find results for a web user's search

What is the Page Rank Algorithm?,A method of ranking web pages based on how important they are for the user's search

What is the damping factor set to in the pagerank algorithm calculation?,0.85

Which side processing is used for more complex processing?,Server-side

What is client-side processing?,Client side processing is when information is processed on the user's local device

What is server-side processing?,Server side processing is when a client sends information to a server for processing

What is a disadvantage of server-side processing?,Busy websites can put excessive demands on web servers

What is a disadvantage of client-side processing?,Relies on the user's device which may not be optimal for the task
